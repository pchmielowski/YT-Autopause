# YT-Autopause
Firefox extension for autopausing Youtube video when window loses focus

## Usage
1. clone the repo or download files
2. go to `about:debugging` page in Firefox
3. click on "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. choose any of the files from the directory (e.g. `manifest.json`)

## TODO:
Well, the plugin is not finished yet. There is a lot to do:
- [ ] Remove jQuery code from the \*.js file - use external dependency
- [ ] Make user able to turn the add-on off
- [ ] Create a button to do :arrow_up:
- [ ] Push to Firefox add-on registry
